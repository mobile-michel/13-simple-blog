[Classless CSS frameworks](https://github.com/topics/classless-css?l=html) are a popular approach to styling web pages without relying on traditional CSS classes. Instead, they utilize utility classes that can be directly applied to HTML elements.

These frameworks provide a set of pre-defined utility classes that can be used to style various aspects of the page, such as typography, spacing, colors, and more. By using these utility classes, developers can easily apply specific styles to elements without the need for custom CSS classes.

Some popular classless CSS frameworks include:

- Tailwind CSS
- Tachyons
- Basscss

These frameworks offer a wide range of utility classes that can be combined to create complex and responsive layouts. They promote a modular and component-based approach to styling, making it easier to maintain and update styles across the entire project.

In addition to the utility classes, classless CSS frameworks often provide configuration options to customize the default styles and generate a tailored CSS file for the project.

By adopting classless CSS frameworks, developers can achieve consistent and efficient styling, reduce the amount of custom CSS code, and improve the overall development workflow.
